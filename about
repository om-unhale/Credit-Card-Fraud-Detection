The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project, undertaken as part of the Analytics Club at IIT Bombay (Decâ€™23), focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Fraud detection in financial transactions is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of financial systems. The dataset, which is often highly imbalanced due to the low frequency of fraudulent transactions, presents significant challenges in accurately predicting fraud.

In this project, I applied several data science techniques to address these challenges and build an effective model. I began with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies in the data. The imbalanced nature of the dataset was handled by employing the **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, improving the model's ability to correctly classify fraudulent transactions.

For model evaluation, I computed the **confusion matrix** and **ROC AUC score**, key metrics used to assess the performance of classification models. I implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, including **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, and **XGBoost**, to compare their performances in predicting fraud. Among these, the **XGBoost classifier** emerged as the best model, achieving an **ROC AUC score of 0.93**. This model was further optimized with **SMOTE** and **StratifiedKFolds cross-validation**, which enhanced its ability to generalize and provided a more robust evaluation of its performance.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply data science techniques to solve real-world problems, handle imbalanced datasets, and evaluate model performance effectively. The insights gained from this analysis can be crucial for financial institutions in preventing fraud and minimizing losses.
